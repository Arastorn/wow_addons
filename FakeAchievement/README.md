Fake Achievement
================
Create fake achievement links to be used in that messages to impress noobs, fake PGMs and make laugh your friends and the girls !

Usage
-----
`/fa <achievement> <date>`
* Achievement can be the achievement ID (retrieved from WoWHead for instance) or any incomplete achievement link
* Date is format is day/month/year. Year is in 2-digit format representing the year of the 21st Century.

Examples
--------
`/fa 4999 8/12/10`
`/fa [Realm First! Level 85] 8/12/10`

The achievement link is generated for the currently targeted player. If you don't have any target, the link is generated for your character. Gives spoofy results with NPCs.

Of course, this won't give you the achievement and the real achievement can be verified in the armory. This is just attended for fun and to shut those arrogant fake PGM's mouths.
