v3.65 [February 5th, 2020]
Changes:
- Vehicle bar is now in core ElvUI. Go complain to Simpy about it :D
Fixes:
- Fixed some frames not being movable when the option was enabled. This also fixes some incompatibilities with Rarity.
- Fixed reputation and currency tabs being totally broken when you move character frame away from its default place without "remember position" option enabled.
- Fixed options being on fire (and not loading)
Additions:
- Corruption eye now moves itself so the scrollbar will not be able to overlay it. Also some options for it to show your corruption levels without mouseovering.

v3.64 [December 23rd, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed install errors
- Fixed random armory error for tooltips

v3.63 [December 15th, 2019]
Fixes:
- Inspect transmog info being wrong. Now it will roll back to just name if no item link is available.
- Fixed potential incompatibility with DejaCharacterStats
- Item Level Gradient option error fixed (Blame Darth)
Additions:
- Added an option to control note and officer note text color in guild dt
- Added slash command /slerror that works just like ElvUI's /luaerror but keeps S&L enabled
Changes:
- Since people apparently can't put two and two together, Armory config group will be show yet again with skins disabled providing no options and a text explanation. Hopefully people can at least read.

v3.62 [December 7th , 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed old armory dbconversion code that kept S&L from loading

v3.61 [December 6th , 2019]
Changes:
- Aura options are gone, cause core ElvUI happened.
Fixes:
- Fixed stats scrollbar feeling like doubling itself
- Some fixes for guild dt. Blame Repooc. (He's right, I have found more since this message lol)
- Sorting fixed for friends. Still blame Repooc.

- Fixed armory trying to convince people they need to enchant their off-hands
Armory:
- Added forgotten option for gems in the armory
- Gradient textures will now also indicate missing stuff
- Decimal values for stats are now working again
- Module copy is now supporting armory
- Added forgotten option for overlay on inspect frame. Blame Darth.

v3.60 [November 10th, 2019]
Requires ElvUI 11.25
Fixes:
- Fixed chat datatpanels no backdrop mode 
Changes:
- Guild datatext was rewritten and now seems more responsive to guild roster updates vs previous version and some minor visual changes
- Armory mode is now rewritten. Some stuff is still missing (e.g. being able to see inspect info with target leaving), but the base is in working order and needs to be tested in real world before we'll be concentrating on small visuals. Also keep in mind that this rewrite will reset all your options for armory.

v3.59 [September 25th, 2019]

Fixes:

- Friends Datatext Fixed

v3.57 [September 6th, 2019]
Requires ElvUI 11.22.

Changes:
- Removed Bags and Actionbars transparent buttons options. ElvUI deals with those now.
- Removed portrait options for unitframes. ElvUI core function now.
Fixes:
- Fixed clean or first time install errors for locales, this compliments changes in ElvUI.

- Fixed (probably) datatext panel errors poping up from time to time.
- S&L Friends datatext now can tell apart retail and classic

v3.564 [August 17, 2019]
Changes:

Fixes:
- Fixed chat tab width being weird.
- Fixed datatext panels throwing errors in some cases when importing settings.
- Fixed some non-global strings to defy the global locale selection.

v3.563 [July 17, 2019]
Additions:

Fixes:
- Armory now reliably detects essences, not showing damn empty gems. They are now full gems!

v3.562 [July 3, 2019]
Fixes:

- Fixed 2 threat position options showing up out of the blue

v3.561 [July 1, 2019]
Additions:

- Added new ore and herb to the list of items deconstruct mode can deal with

v3.56 [June 25, 2019]
Additions:

- Added offset options for target and threat indicators on nameplates
Changes:
- Accounted for changes in ElvUI
- Higher overlay portrait option was removed. Core ElvUI now

v3.551 [June 6th, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed tooltip issues with deconstruct button. It should now hide correctly.

v3.55 [May 31st, 2019]
Changes:

v3.54 [May 16th, 2019]
Fixes:

- Fixed wrong raid progress tooltipp
Changes:
- Sort of support for changes in ElvUI 11.11

v3.53 [April 7th, 2019]
Fixes:

- Fixed M+ banner not disappearing when corresponding option is enabled. Statusbar skin and affix style comming at later date.

- Fixed vehicle bar not thinking crabs are vehicles
- Fixed tooltip appearing for a split-second on raid markers when tooltips are turned off for those
- Fixed war campaing auto order
- Fixed some profile swap errors

Known issues:
Armory items breaking is still under investigation.

v3.521 [March 13th, 2019]
Fixes:
- Fixed install layout profile not having correct raid frame visibility. It should be [nogroup] hide; show
Changes:
- Moving chat datapanels down is still off by default. I'll just reiterate this one again. I want default looks of s&l be as close to original ElvUI as possible. Armory being obvious exception.
Option to enbale that back is under /ec - S&L - Modules - Datatext - Override Chat DT Panels
- Added WardrobeFrame to the list of stuff you can move around

v3.52 [March 12th, 2019]
Version for patch 8.1.5 and ElvUI v11. Please do not update to this version if it is tuesday and you play on EU.
Additions:
- Totally forgot raids exist. Added LFR tracking options for Dazar'Alor and Crucible of Storms. Also added those to raid progression (which also should be working again)
Changes:
- Vehicle seat option removed. ElvUI's core option is enough.
- New ElvUI nameplates support (probably shouldn't blow up)
- Viewport (if you know where it is) is now following new scaling system in ElvUI. Max/min values are still the same. If those somehow will happen to not be enough, let me know.
- New install layout. Keep in mind that those are settings I play with, thus assuming you'll love it at the first glance is wrong. Also this is a "basic" frame of what I use, not included most class/character specific stuff.
So if you are not sure if you should use it, don't. You'll save both your and my time on weird questions like "what on earth is this chtulhu shaped thing on my nameplate?"
- Moving chat data panels down is now off by default
Fixes:
- Fixed errors for order hall/ war campaign talent frame dropping errors when opened for the first time with movable blizz frames enabled (and set to record positions)
This fix overrules old code to prevent some frames randomly jumping around. They shouldn't behave like crazy, but keep a tranq rifle just in case.
- A check was put in place to prevent unknown force from populating saved positions for frames with some next level crazy stuff, resulting in inability to export private options.
- Fixed an error in location panel when trying to open portal menu with no hearthstone of any description being in the inventory or toybox.
- Fixed copy-paste fail in unitframes options causing portrait settings applying only after ui reload
- Another attempt at finding the root of Armory breaking at random. If this doesn't help, I'll need more test info.

Possible issues:
- I wasn't able to test how S&L's quest log collapce/hide feature works with ElvUI's feature to hide in arenas.
Probably will have issues. Please report if you notice something off.
- Some frames will be auto repositioning other frames on first ever load after latest movable frames changes. After that everything should be fine.

v3.511 [March 3rd, 2019]
Fixes:
- Disabling armory now should correctly allow ElvUI to display gear ilvl and enchants (I blame Simpy)
- Fixed stats and stat scrollbar being broken (Still blaming Simpy)

v3.51 [February 24th, 2019]
Requires ElvUI 10.88 to work properly
Misc:
- Adjustments needed to work with ElvUI 10.88 error free (hopefully)

v3.5 [January 22nd, 2019]
Additions:
- Armory and afk screen now support Wakanda trolls and humans living on ships
- Character armory option to color ilvl text based on quality now allows you to select another variant - based on items ilvl compared to average equipped ilvl. Same or higher ilvl will be green, all below will become more red the bigger the difference is.
This one will probably be not accurate for low level toons due to math used here is some afroengineeringï¿½ and based on max level toons ilvl numbers.
Fixes:
- Rep text now properly shows reputation gains toward that sweet (not) paragon chest
- Fixed icons on datatetxs not following mouseover on load or changing datatexts
- DBM icon for skinned minimap button is now correct
Misc:
- Some profile db conversion was added to account for ilvl text coloring option. Last one with hearthstone priority went withoput problems, but who knows. Just keep an eye on it.
- More attempts to fix seemingly random issue with character armory breaking on equipping new gear. If it breaks again, I'll need as much info of what happened for about a minute period before everything went to hell.

v3.492 [December 19, 2018]
Fixes:
- Localtion panel coordinates link is now working again
Changes:

v3.481 [November 21st 2018]

- Fixed AzeriteTooltip compatibility with armory

Changes:
- Tab handling functions were rewritten. Now with any sizing option selected they should properly do "overflow" behavior and show select dropdown buttons for tabs not on screen.
- LFR info on in time datatext will only show active wings info. Blizz functions for getting LFR data are in even more broken than before so they return wrong info about wings and raids you can't get into by using LFG tool.
- Attempting to deal with weird sorting errors in toolbars. Not sure if that will help.
- Removed 3 currencies used by warfronts only from currency datatext.
- Removed an option to reposition incoming healing bars.
- Removed tooltip offset options for tooltip showing up at cursor position. This is in default ElvUI now.
